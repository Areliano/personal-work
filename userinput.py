#Write a program that accepts user input to create a list of integers. Then, compute the sum of all the integers in the list.
a = int(input(f"Enter the first number: "))
b = int(input(f"Enter the second number: "))
c = int(input(f"Enter the third number: "))
d = int(input(f"Enter the fourth number: "))
e = int(input(f"Enter the fifth number: "))
print('you entered the following numbers in your list: ', a, b, c, d, e)
sum = a + b + c + d + e
print('The sum of the numbers is: ', sum)
